With the current health climate of the world this information could be very useful for seeing how companies were able to adjust to a massive shift in how work is able to be done. Remote work is something that a lot of companies are trying to institute and has even more benefits now than it did a year ago. Looking at the status of remote work, along with financial data, could produce insights into the importance of remote work for companies in the future.
